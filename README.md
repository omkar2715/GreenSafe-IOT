# GreenSafe-IoT 🌱📶

GreenSafe-IoT is an IoT-based solution designed to help transport and store organic products in a safe environment. It detects real-time environmental data using sensors 
(like temperature, humidity, and gas sensors) and sends the data to a dashboard. This ensures organic products are kept in ideal conditions throughout the supply chain.

##  Features

- 🌡️ Real-time environmental data monitoring (temperature, humidity, gas levels, etc.)
- 🔔 Alert system for hazardous conditions
- 📊 Dashboard for data visualization
- 🌐 Cloud integration for remote monitoring
- 🔌 Low-power embedded system
- 🔒 Secure data handling

##  Tech Stack

- **Hardware:** Arduino/ESP32, DHT11, MQ Gas Sensor, Soil Moisture Sensor
- **Backend:** Firebase / Node.js / MQTT (based on your implementation)
- **Frontend:** Web dashboard (HTML, CSS, JS or React)
- **Communication:** Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / LoRa (as per your config)

##  How It Works

1. Sensors collect environmental data.
2. Microcontroller processes data and sends to cloud.
3. Alerts generated if threshold is crossed.
4. Data displayed on web dashboard for user monitoring.

##  Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
2. Upload firmware to your board (via Arduino IDE or PlatformIO).
3. Set up Firebase/MQTT and update credentials in the code.
4. Run the web dashboard:
5. Power up your sensors and monitor the readings live.
